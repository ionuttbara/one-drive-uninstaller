This is a batch script to completely uninstall OneDrive in Windows 10 and 11.

It'll only take a moment and could save you hours of grief...
Simply download the latest 'Onedrive Uninstaller' package file then run the script in Administrator mode (by right clicking on the file and selecting 'Run as Administrator') to completely and totally remove OneDrive.

# Please read this!

Be aware that removing OneDrive WILL break access to existing OneDrive accounts and delelete locally stored files on the machine you run this script on.
It may also break access to roaming profiles, App Store configuration, and cloud based windows settings (for example, if you use a Microsoft account instead of a local account to log on to your machine).
If you don't use that stuff, you are home free (but check anyway).
After apply, your PC will automaticly reboot.

In any case, be sure to BACK UP YOUR STUFF!! (You should be doing this regularly anyway, like a good little boy/girl...)
Also, if you are unsure, take an image of your HDD, or at least set a restore point or something... anything... (please).....

Let me know if you find a bug or if you want any improvements or features.

Peace out.
